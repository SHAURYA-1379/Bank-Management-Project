# Bank-Management-Project

Banking is more than just a place for money; it's a complex system involving various management and other systems. 
This project provides a brief introduction to banking systems and outlines its objectives.

It focuses on three key areas of finance:
1) Account management.
2) Transaction registration.
3) Agent management.

The project details the software development lifecycle, hardware and software requirements, an entity-relationship model, and a data flow diagram to illustrate the system's structure and data flow.
The final project includes front-end displays with corresponding code, database structure, conclusions, and suggestions for future enhancements.
